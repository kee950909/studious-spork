        <h2>About:</h2>
        <h4>My Name is Kevin Evers and I am an Outdoor Recreation and Education Professional turned Front-End Web Developer. I am originally from Dayton, Ohio and attended Ohio University, graduating with a Bachelors of Science degree in Outdoor Recreation and Education in 2013. I have spent the last 10+ years in the wilderness therapy and parks and recreation industries, accumulating a wealth of experiences along the way. It is my hope that upon completion of the University of North Carolina Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp that I am prepared to enter the world of front end web development, with an emphasis on partnering with those businesses, organizations, and stakeholders who are based within the fields of outdoor recreation and education.</h4></section>
